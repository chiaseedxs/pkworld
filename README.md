About The Project
![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]

For parkour athletes looking for training locations.

This app allows you to search any location in the world, and mark a spot or gym so that others will know the location. If you dont know the location of a spot, but know the spot name, you can also search exclusively by marked locations and if another user has marked it, you will be shown the marker.

The events page will list upcoming events in order of which events are closest to you. The users page will do the same and include contact information for athletes in database.

Parkour athletes name spots by landmark and give directions by landmark. In a sport that relies on travelling to foreign locations, searching for "Mini Spot", three blocks towards the river from "Blue Rails" can cause you to waste a lot of training time walking in circles.

With this app, a local athlete can mark "Mini Spot" on the map, so that you dont have to decipher ambiguous directions. Just type the name and search the marker.
